# Educational Metaverse(Immersive Classroom)

Information:-
With this immersive classroom platform, students can experience their education in more immersive and engaging ways. We transport students from their desks to the Roman ruins to show them history or let them mix volatile chemicals and see the reaction without being physically harmed, or even see how the heart functions visually. 

And voice AI teachers in this platform can also adapt to each student's level of knowledge, speed of learning and provide instant help outside classrooms - so they're getting the most out of their education. 

As a result, the teacher’s role is shifted from delivering content to facilitating learning. “Teachers will be focused on creating conditions for exploring, rather than providing ready-made knowledge.
